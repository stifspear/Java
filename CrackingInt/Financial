I am applying for Financial Aid because I cannot afford to pay this amount right now. I am a student and belong to a third world country. My mom is a single working mother. I have one small brother and one elder sister. She cannot manage to pay for this course after paying for I, my brother and sister. My mom is hardly able to pay for our college fees. In India, income is very low and study expense is very high compared to the income earned by my mother. Monthly expense that I get from my mom is mere $100 including my foods and living cost. I cannot afford this from my pocket money. This course will only be a burden for my mom so I will be very grateful if I get Financial Aid for this course and the rest of the specialization course. I learned a lot from my previous course on coursera. I got Financial Aid for my previous course and am hoping I will get one for this too. Thank You.

I have done part one of this specialization and I learned a lot from my previous course. Education system in our college is very old style. We are not taught what is required in the real corporate world. From this course I am trying to acquire the skills that will be necessary to be successful in a corporate world. I have to have one valuable  skills that will help me succeed in life. My aim is to work for a big company and this course was mentioned in the google's guide for software developers. This course will help me for my project that I will be doing for my college. I am to make a project that is useful in the real world and in my opinion website recommendation application(capstone project in this course) is one such project. I just wanted to do the capstone project for this specialization but I have to complete all the 4 prerequisite courses to do that so I need financial aid to complete these four courses.
